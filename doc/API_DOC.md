###Querying
####Everything

In this section, we will get the result from a query of any type, this will appear in `Everything` tab, the query is what will be input in the SoundCloud search bar.

Consider the following base URL:
```
https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/search?  
```
Using this base URL with some parameters, we can query for a general search in SoundCloud, which will return items for the query.

For the purpose of this project, api parameter only include a few options, those parameters are:
```
q={YOUR_QUERY}  
client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}  
limit={QUERY_RESULT_LIMIT}  
linked_partitioning=1
```
With each parameter separated by `&`, we have the full api query request as follows:
```
https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/search?q={YOUR_QUERY}&client_id={YOUR_CLIENT_ID}&limit={QUERY_RESULT_LIMIT}&linked_partitioning=1
```
An example of a query search for the term `hello world` may be as follows:
```
https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/search?q=hello%20world&client_id=xxxxx&limit=20&linked_partitioning=1
```
This will return the `20` first result for `hello world` (notice that the `xxx...` are to be replaced with actual `client_id`)

The response from the above request may be represented in `JSON format:
```JSON
{
  "collection": [...],
  "total_results": 10000,
  "next_href": "https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/search?query_urn=soundcloud%3Asearch%3Afa128d89a8d44b76817c180aab6fe0f2&limit=20&offset=20&q=hello%20world",
  "query_urn": "soundcloud:search:fa128d89a8d44b76817c180aab6fe0f2"
}
```

- `collection` is a list of results with the length of the requested `limit` parameter, in this case, the `20` item will be returned and stored in this field, we can start extracting this as data.

- `total_result` is the total result of the search query
- `next_href` however, is what we must care about, for this contain a link of the next `20` result (or `limit` parameter value).

Parameter `next_href` will be concatenated with `client_id` to produce the next url for api request:
```python
new_url = response['next_href'] + '&{client_id}'
```

This URL will be used to get the next set of results, this process keeps looping until the field `next_href` no longer appears in the response result.
